    "- Example\n",
    "  - consider a coin for which the probability of head $x_{h}$ is $p(x_{h})=0.9$ and the probability of a tail $p(x_{t})=(1-0.9)=0.1$\n",
    "  - If we flip this coin twice then there are four possible pairs out outcomes:\n",
    "    - two heads $(x_{h},x_{h})$, two tails ($x_{t},x_{t}$), a head followed by a tail($x_{h},x_{t}$), and a tail followed by a head ($x_{t},x_{h}$)\n",
    "  - The probability that the first outcome is a head and the second outcome is a tail can be represented as a **joint probability** $p(x_{h},x{t})$\n",
    "  - In order to work out some averages, imagine that we perform 100 pairs of coin flips. We label each flip according to whether it came first or second within its pair, so we have 100 **first flip** outcomes, and 100 corresponding **second flip** outcomes\n",

    "- After Shannon's paper, it became apparent that information is a well-defined and, above all, **measurable** quantity\n",
    "- Shannon's theory of information\n",
    "  - provides a mathematical definition of information\n",
    "  - describes precisely how much information can be communicated between different elements of a system\n",
    "- Though this might not sound a much, Shannon's theory underpins our understanding of \n",
    "  - how signals and noise are related, \n",
    "  - and why there are definite limits to the rate at which information can be communicated within any system, whether man-made or biological\n",

    "    - 'data' means a combination of 'useful' signals and 'uselss' noise\n",
    "    - The ability to separate signal from noise, to extract information from data, is crucial for modern telecommunications\n",
